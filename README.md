# Verlet-Physics-Engine
This is a basic Verlet physics engine

I made this after watching a video of someone who created amazing physics simulations with Verlet physics. Verlet physics isn't a truly accurate simuulation, but it's very easy to implement in comparison to the nightmare that is the systems of equations for modeling collisions. While it could be done with that, it just wasn't as fun as just making a simple physics engine.

Run VerletRunner.java to start the program.
